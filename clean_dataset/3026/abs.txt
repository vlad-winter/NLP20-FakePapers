Human eye movement mechanisms (saccades) are very useful for scene analysis, including object representation and pattern recognition. In this letter, a Hopfield neural network to emulate saccades is proposed. The network uses an energy function that includes location and identification tasks. Computer simulation shows that the network performs those tasks cooperatively. The result suggests that the network is applicable to shift-invariant pattern recognition.
