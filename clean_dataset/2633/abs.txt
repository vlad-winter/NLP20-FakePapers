In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on the problem of person re-identification (re-id) . The re-id techniques attempt to match the images of pedestrians from disjoint non-overlapping camera views. A major challenge of re-id is the serious intra-class variations caused by changing viewpoints. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep neural network-based framework which utilizes the view information in the feature extraction stage. The proposed framework learns a view-specific network for each camera view with a cross-view Euclidean constraint (CV-EC) and a cross-view center loss (CV-CL) . We utilize CV-EC to decrease the margin of the features between diverse views and extend the center loss metric to a view-specific version to better adapt the re-id problem. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the parameters of the view-specific networks from coarse to fine. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of the existing deep networks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the VIPeR, CUHKN, CUHKN, SYSU-mReId, and Market-N benchmarks.
