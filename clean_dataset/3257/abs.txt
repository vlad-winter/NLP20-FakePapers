This paper addresses the challenge of establishing a bridge between deep convolutional neural networks and conventional object detection frameworks for accurate and efficient generic object detection. We introduce Dense Neural Patterns, short for DNPs, which are dense local features derived from discriminatively trained deep convolutional neural networks. DNPs can be easily plugged into conventional detection frameworks in the same way as other dense local features (like HOG or LBP) . The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the Regionlets object detection framework. It achieved N \% mean average precision on the PASCAL VOC N dataset, and N \% on the PASCAL VOC N dataset, which dramatically improves the original Regionlets approach without DNPs.
