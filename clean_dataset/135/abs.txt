Deep Neural nets (NNs) with millions of parameters are at the heart of many state-of-the-art computer vision systems today. However, recent works have shown that much smaller models can achieve similar levels of performance. In this work, we address the problem of pruning parameters in a trained NN model. Instead of removing individual weights one at a time as done in previous works, we remove one neuron at a time. We show how similar neurons are redundant, and propose a systematic way to remove them. Our experiments in pruning the densely connected layers show that we can remove upto N \% of the total parameters in an MNIST-trained network, and about N \% for AlexNet without significantly affecting performance. Our method can be applied on top of most networks with a fully connected layer to give a smaller network.
