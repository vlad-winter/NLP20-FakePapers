This study poses the feature correspondence problem as a hypergraph node labeling problem. Candidate feature matches and their subsets (usually of size larger than two) are considered to be the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph. A hypergraph labeling algorithm, which models the subset-wise interaction by an undirected graphical model, is applied to label the nodes (feature correspondences) as correct or incorrect. We describe a method to learn the cost function of this labeling algorithm from labeled examples using a graphical model training algorithm. The proposed feature matching algorithm is different from the most of the existing learning point matching methods in terms of the form of the objective function, the cost function to be learned and the optimization method applied to minimize it. The results on standard datasets demonstrate how learning over a hypergraph improves the matching performance over existing algorithms, notably one that also uses higher order information without learning.
