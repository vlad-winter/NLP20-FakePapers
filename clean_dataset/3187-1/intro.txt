advancements in the sensor technology bring exciting possibilities in hyperspectral satellite imaging (HSI) which is being actively applied in various domains, including precision agriculture, surveillance, military, land cover applications, and more~ _cite_ . It captures a wide spectrum of light for each pixel---such detailed information can be effectively exploited in HSI (assigning a class label to each pixel) and (determining the boundaries of objects of a given class in an input HSI) ~ _cite_ . However, hyperspectral data's high dimensionality is an important challenge towards its efficient analysis, transfer, and storage. There are two approaches for dealing with such noisy, almost always imbalanced, and often redundant data. algorithms (with principal component analysis and its variations being the mainstream~ _cite_) generate new low-dimensional descriptors from hyperspectral images, whereas techniques retrieve a subset of all HSI bands carrying the most important information. Although the former approaches can be applied to reduced HSI sets, they are generally exploited to process raw HSI data, they are computationally-expensive, can suffer from band noisiness, and may not be interpretable~ _cite_ . Band selection techniques are divided into (unsupervised) and (supervised) algorithms. Applied before classification, filter approaches do not require ground-truth data to select specific bands~ _cite_ . They, however, suffer from several drawbacks: (i) ~it is difficult to select the optimal dimensionality of the reduced feature space, (ii) ~band correlations are often disregarded, leading to the data redundancy~ _cite_, (iii) ~bands which might be informative when combined with others are removed, and (iv) ~noisy bands are often labeled as informative due to low correlation with other bands. Wrapper approaches use the classifier performance as the objective function for optimizing the subset of HSI bands~ _cite_ . Although these methods decrease the memory requirements of the further HSI analysis, such algorithms induce serious computational overhead. In this work, we mitigate this problem, and incorporate the selection process into the deep network training. Such approaches have not been explored so far. Deep learning (DL) has enabled unprecedented achievements and established the state of the art in a plethora of domains, including HSI analysis~ _cite_ . In general, the HSI classification and segmentation algorithms encompass machine learning techniques which require feature engineering~ _cite_, and DL approaches~ _cite_ . DL can conveniently elaborate features~ _cite_, or both and features without any user intervention. These features are intrinsically extracted by the deep nets operating on the full HSI. Therefore, we need to face the aforementioned challenges concerning the high HSI dimensionality in both conventional and DL-powered segmentation approaches. Attention mechanisms allow humans and animals to effectively process enormous amount of visual stimuli by focusing only on the most-informative chunks of data. An analogous approach can be applied in DL to localize the most informative parts of an input image to on. We build upon the painless attention mechanism which is trained during the network's forward-backward pass~ _cite_, and exploit it in our convolutional architectures for HSI band selection. To the best of our knowledge, attention mechanisms have been used neither for this purpose, nor for HSI classification/segmentation before. In this paper, we introduce a new HSI band selection method (Section~ _ref_) which exploits attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and is applicable to any HSI data (i.e., ~with different numbers of bands) . The goal of this system is to learn which bands convey the most important information, as an outcome of the training process (alongside a ready-to-use trained deep model) . It is in contrast to the wrapper band selection techniques which require training a supervised learner to assess the quality of selected subsets of bands during the optimization. Thus, our method is an approach---the generation of attention heatmaps is embedded into the CNN training. These heatmaps quantify the of specific parts of the spectrum, and they are later processed using an anomaly detection algorithm. We build upon our observation that only a (very) small subset of all bands within an original HSI convey the important information (necessary to distinguish the underlying materials), and these bands can be seen as (the other bands, which are in the majority, are not informative) . The contribution of this work is multi-fold, and can be summarized in the following bullet points: This paper is organized as follows. Section~ _ref_ reviews the current advances in automated HSI band selection. In Section~ _ref_, which begins with a gentle introduction to the DL concepts used in this paper (Section~ _ref_), we present our band selection algorithm. Experimental results are discussed in Section~ _ref_ . Section~ _ref_ concludes the paper.
