Many works have concentrated on visualizing and understanding the inner mechanism of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by generating images that activate some specific neurons, which is called deep visualization. However, it is still unclear what the filters extract from images intuitively. In this paper, we propose a modified code inversion algorithm, called feature map inversion, to understand the function of filter of interest in CNNs. We reveal that every filter extracts a specific texture. The texture from higher layer contains more colours and more intricate structures. We also demonstrate that style of images could be a combination of these texture primitives. Two methods are proposed to reallocate energy distribution of feature maps randomly and purposefully. Then, we inverse the modified code and generate images of diverse styles. With these results, we provide an explanation about why Gram matrix of feature maps _cite_ could represent image style.
